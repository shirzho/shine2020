  Hey there! This site was built as a side project as part of the AIGA DC SHINE 2020 Design mentorship program in an attempt to improve my digital illustration skills and bring in the stories of local Asian American businesses in the DMV to understand what they're going through and most importantly to support them by buying their delicious food :)

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), an open-source static site generator
* Using the template [Lanyon Theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with good ole' [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com)
